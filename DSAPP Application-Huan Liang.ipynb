If I have that information, then I am able to find the relationship between poverty level and social economic status of the zip code. This goes along for all schools that are projects in the spreadsheet. While I know that the poverty level is dependent on percentage of students who get reduced lunches, it is also useful to have a concrete number, such as median income earned in the zip area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another question I have for my project partner is what conditions make a school eligible to become a project? Like I stated earlier, urban schools dominate the projects, but we know that there are rural areas that need help as well. \n",
    "In addition, there is little quantitative data about the projects overall. For example, what was the outcome measure after the project was completed? Did this see an increase in the rate of graduation or college attendance? Since many of the projects took place at primary schools, did the boost for the younger children sustain across the rest of their education?"
